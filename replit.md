## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend with hot reload
- **Type Checking**: `npm run check` validates TypeScript across the project
- **Database Migrations**: `npm run db:push` applies schema changes

### Production Build
- **Frontend Build**: Vite builds React application to `dist/public`
- **Backend Build**: ESBuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
- **Unified Serving**: Express serves both API and static frontend files

### Environment Configuration
- **Database**: Requires `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for PostgreSQL connection
- **Node Environment**: Uses `NODE_ENV` to differentiate development and production modes
- **Asset Paths**: Configurable paths for attached assets and static files

### Scalability Considerations
- **Database Migration**: Ready to switch from in-memory to PostgreSQL storage
- **API Caching**: React Query provides client-side caching for API responses
- **Static Assets**: Prepared for CDN integration for image and asset delivery
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session store configured for user authentication
